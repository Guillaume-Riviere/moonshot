# 2nd Project ( TreasuryBar ) #WAITING

## Description

The concept of the project is to create a device that allow people to pay for their drinks with bracelet that they can recharge with their credit card.
It would allow small bars to have a cashless system and to avoid the problem of people who don't have cash.

## How it works

The device is composed of a raspberry pi, a screen, a printer, a card reader and a bracelet reader.
The user can buy a bracelet and recharge it with his credit card. The bracelet is then linked to the user's account.
When the user wants to pay for his drink, he just have to scan his bracelet and the device will print a receipt with the amount of the drink.

It would be a Plug and Play device that can be installed in any bar.

## Objectives

The main objective of the project is to create a device that can be used in bars and that can be installed in a few minutes.
It would help to reduce waiters change errors.
It would reduce the payment time ( Bank card payment can take up to 30 seconds ).
It would help end customers to manage their money.
